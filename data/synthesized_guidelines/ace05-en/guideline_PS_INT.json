Examples include 'Colorado' in a legal ruling or 'United States' in an auction settlement. The place can refer to the jurisdiction or area associated with the transaction, such as 'Belgrade' in a property transfer case.",
            "recipient": "The recipient is the entity that directly receives the money in the transaction, which may or may not be the ultimate beneficiary. Examples include 'Democrats' in a donation or 'neighbor' in a compensation case. The recipient can be an individual, organization, or group, such as 'firms' receiving a fine payment or a 'center' funded by a donation."

    },
    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "The TransferOwnership event is triggered by the transfer of ownership of an artifact from one entity to another. This event involves a change in possession or control of an artifact, which can be physical or intellectual property, and is typically characterized by the involvement of a seller and a buyer. The scope of this event includes any transaction where an artifact is transferred, regardless of the medium or context, such as selling a business or acquiring a property. Triggers for this event include terms like 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', 'provide', 'donate', and 'gift'. The primary outcome of this event is the change in ownership of the artifact, distinguishing it from events like TransferMoney, which focus on the transfer of funds.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "artifact": "The artifact is the item or entity being transferred in the event. Examples include 'apartment', 'operations', 'hotel', 'property', 'business', 'parks', and 'division'. It can be tangible, like 'property', or intangible, like 'operations'. In specific contexts, the artifact could be specialized, such as 'nuclear weapons' in a geopolitical scenario or 'shares' in a financial transaction. Edge cases include scenarios where the artifact is implied rather than explicitly mentioned, such as 'selling everything'. Unlike TransferMoney, which focuses on the amount, TransferOwnership focuses on the specific item or entity being transferred.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that benefits from the transfer, often receiving the artifact. Examples include 'nanny'. The beneficiary can be an individual or an organization and is important as it identifies who gains from the transaction. In some cases, the beneficiary might not be directly involved in the transaction but still receives the benefits, such as 'a charity' receiving a donated artifact. Edge cases include scenarios where the beneficiary is a group or community, such as 'residents' benefiting from a transferred public asset. Unlike the buyer, the beneficiary does not necessarily provide compensation for the artifact; they simply receive the benefits.",
            "buyer": "The buyer is the entity that acquires the artifact in exchange for compensation. Examples include 'company', 'Andrew Harris', 'firm', and 'Blackstone Group'. The buyer is essential as it represents the party gaining ownership of the artifact, often providing monetary or other forms of compensation. In specific contexts, the buyer could be a corporate entity, an individual, or a government body, depending on the nature of the transaction. Edge cases include scenarios where the buyer is a consortium or partnership, such as 'a group of investors' acquiring a business. Unlike the beneficiary, the buyer is actively involved in the transaction and provides compensation for the artifact.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transfer of ownership occurs or where the artifact is situated. Examples include 'Belgrade'. The place is significant as it provides context to the transaction, indicating where the transfer is taking place or where the artifact is located. In specific contexts, the place could be a specific address, a city, or even a virtual location in the case of digital assets. Edge cases include scenarios where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the headquarters' implying the company's main office. Unlike the artifact, which is the item being transferred, the place provides the geographical or situational context of the transfer.",
            "seller": "The seller is the entity that transfers ownership of the artifact in exchange for compensation. Examples include 'Mirjana Markovic', 'USA Interactive', 'Vivendi', and 'group'. The seller is crucial as it represents the party relinquishing ownership of the artifact, often receiving monetary or other forms of compensation. In specific contexts, the seller could be an individual, a corporation, or a government entity, depending on the nature of the transaction. Edge cases include scenarios where the seller is a consortium or partnership, such as 'a group of shareholders' selling their stakes. Unlike the buyer, the seller is the party that initiates the transfer of ownership and receives compensation for the artifact."

    },
    "Transport(MovementEvent)": {
        "description": "The Transport event, a subtype of MovementEvent, is triggered by verbs or phrases indicating the movement of entities from one place to another, such as 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'parachute', and 'cart'. This event involves an agent or vehicle facilitating the movement and an artifact or victim being moved, typically with a clear origin and destination. Unlike other MovementEvent types, the Transport event specifically focuses on the conveyance of entities, often emphasizing the means or method of transportation. Triggers like 'walk', 'run', or 'swim' indicate other MovementEvent types, not Transport. The outcome of a Transport event is the successful relocation of the artifact or victim to a new place, facilitated by an agent or vehicle.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for facilitating the transport, such as 'forces', 'medical teams', 'parents', or organizations like 'US forces' or 'police'. The agent initiates and manages the transport process and is distinct from the artifact or victim being transported. In some cases, the agent may be implied but not explicitly mentioned.",
            "artifact": "The artifact is the entity being transported, such as 'women', 'children', 'victims', 'protesters', or individuals like 'Liana Owen'. The artifact is the primary focus of the transport event, being moved from one location to another. Artifacts can be individuals, groups, or objects and do not facilitate the transport but are the subject of the movement. Edge cases include collective groups like 'troops' or 'protesters'.",
            "destination": "The destination is the endpoint of the transport, such as 'Sudan', 'Iraq', 'Manhattan', 'home', or 'airfield'. It defines the scope and goal of the transport event, indicating where the artifact or victim is intended to arrive. Unlike the origin, the destination is the final point in the transport process. It may be implied but not explicitly mentioned in some scenarios.",
            "origin": "The origin is the starting point of the transport, such as 'Sudan', 'Pennsylvania', or 'Fort Hood'. It provides context for where the transport begins, indicating the location from which the artifact or victim is moved. Unlike the destination, the origin is the initial point in the transport process and may be implied but not explicitly mentioned in some scenarios.",
            "place": "The place is a general location associated with the transport event, such as 'Iraq'. It provides additional context, often indicating a broader area involved in the event. Unlike the origin or destination, the place may not specify a start or end point but helps situate the event geographically. Edge cases include large regions or countries like 'across the United States and Canada'.",
            "vehicle": "The vehicle is the means of transportation used in the event, such as 'trains', cars, planes, or ships. It is crucial for understanding how the transport is facilitated, serving as the tool or method used for the transport, not the entity facilitating it. The vehicle may be implied but not explicitly mentioned in some scenarios.",
            "victim": "The victim is the entity being transported, often in a context of harm or distress, such as 'who' or 'victims'. Victims are a specific type of artifact, typically involving individuals in need of assistance or rescue, often highlighted in emergency or medical transport contexts. Unlike general artifacts, victims are usually associated with negative or urgent circumstances. Edge cases include larger groups like 'dozens of wounded victims'."

    "TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The TrialHearing event, a type of JusticeEvent, is triggered by legal proceedings where a case is being heard or tried in a court of law. This event involves an adjudicator, a defendant, and often a prosecutor, and takes place in a specific location such as a court or city. Unlike related events such as 'Appeal' or 'Sentence', this event focuses on the process of hearing or trying a case rather than the outcome or subsequent legal actions. The outcome of this event is not the final judgment or sentence but the process of presenting evidence, arguments, and legal proceedings in front of an adjudicator. Example triggers include 'hearing', 'trial', 'case', and 'tried'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator, such as a judge, court, or jury, is the authority presiding over the trial or hearing, responsible for making legal decisions. This role is crucial for ensuring the trial or hearing is conducted fairly and according to the law. Examples include 'judge' in 'an oklahoma city judge has ruled' and 'Supreme Court'. Unlike the prosecutor or defendant, the adjudicator is neutral and does not represent either party. In some cases, the adjudicator may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the court said'.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity being tried or heard in the legal proceedings, such as 'nichols', 'Anwar Ibrahim', or 'Markovic'. The defendant's role is to respond to the charges or claims brought against them. There may be multiple defendants in some cases, such as 'officials' in 'Markovic will be tried along with 10 other Milosevic-era officials'. Unlike the prosecutor, the defendant is the party accused or charged in the trial or hearing. The defendant may not always be explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the wife' in 'Milosevic's wife will go on trial'.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the trial or hearing is taking place, such as 'oklahoma city', 'Belgrade', or 'New York'. It provides context for the jurisdiction and legal authority overseeing the trial or hearing. Examples include 'oklahoma city' in 'an oklahoma city judge has ruled' and 'Belgrade district court'. Unlike the adjudicator or defendant, the place is a geographical location and not a person or entity involved in the trial or hearing. The place may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the court' in 'the court said'.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor is the individual or entity presenting the case against the defendant in the trial or hearing, such as 'prosecutors', 'lawyer', or 'prosecution'. The prosecutor's role is to provide evidence and arguments to prove the defendant's guilt or liability. Examples include 'prosecutors' in 'prosecutors presented enough evidence' and 'lawyer'. Unlike the defendant, the prosecutor represents the state or the party bringing the charges or claims in the trial or hearing. The prosecutor may not always be explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the prosecution' in 'following an agreement with the prosecution'."
