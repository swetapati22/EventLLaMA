This event involves the legal exoneration of the defendant, releasing them from all charges and associated penalties. It is distinct from other justice events such as 'Convict', 'ArrestJail', or 'Sentence', which result in a guilty verdict, arrest, or imposition of penalties, respectively.

This event involves law enforcement or other authorities taking a person into custody, often in connection with a suspected crime or legal violation. Unlike the 'Convict' event, which involves a legal judgment of guilt, the 'ArrestJail' event focuses on the act of taking someone into custody, regardless of whether they have been formally charged or convicted. Triggers such as 'arrested' and 'held' are indicative of this event type, distinguishing it from events like 'Sue' or 'Convict', which involve legal proceedings and judgments.

It is not the same as the location of the crime itself but rather where the legal action is initiated or processed. The place can vary widely, from specific courts to broader jurisdictions, and helps identify the legal framework and authority under which the charges are brought.",

The person argument is crucial for understanding who is gaining freedom, for instance, 'Anwar' in 'Anwar, 56, who this week completed four years in prison'. In 'ReleaseParole', the person is typically someone who has been in confinement and is now being released, often under specific conditions. This is different from 'Execute' where the person is subject to capital punishment. The person argument can also include pronouns or references to individuals, such as 'he' or 'who', as seen in 'who was released on parole earlier this year'.

In 'ReleaseParole', the place is typically a facility where the individual was confined, such as a prison or detention center. This is different from 'TrialHearing' where the place might be a courtroom. The place argument helps to distinguish the physical location of the release, which is a key aspect of the event. For example, 'prison' in 'completed four years in prison'. Unlike the 'place' in events like 'Meet' or 'Demonstrate', which might refer to locations of gatherings or protests, the place in 'ReleaseParole' specifically refers to the site of confinement and subsequent release."

            "giver": "The giver is the entity that provides the money in the transaction. This can be an individual, organization, or group, such as 'Planned Parenthood' in donations or 'girls' in compensation cases. The giver's role is to identify the source of the monetary transfer, and in some cases, multiple givers may be involved. The giver may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transfer of money occurs or is relevant. This can refer to a geographical location, jurisdiction, or venue related to the transaction, such as 'Colorado' in compensation cases or 'United States' in auction settlements. The place provides context about where the transaction is taking place or has legal relevance, even if not explicitly mentioned.",
            "recipient": "The recipient is the entity that directly receives the money in the transaction. This can be an individual, organization, or group, such as 'Democrats' in donations or 'neighbor' in compensation cases. The recipient's role is to identify who directly gets the money, and in some cases, the recipient and the beneficiary may be the same entity. The recipient may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context."

    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "The TransferOwnership event is triggered by the transfer of ownership of an artifact from one entity to another. This event is characterized by a change in possession or control of an artifact, typically involving a buyer and a seller. Triggers include terms like 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', 'provide', 'donate', and 'gift', provided they result in a change of ownership. Events such as 'renting', 'leasing', 'lend', or 'borrow' do not qualify as they do not involve a change in ownership. The outcome of this event is the transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer or beneficiary, distinguishing it from events where ownership does not change, such as 'use' or 'consume'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, such as 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', or 'provide'.",
            "artifact": "The artifact is the item or entity whose ownership is being transferred, and it is central to the event. Examples include 'apartment', 'operations', 'hotel', 'property', 'business', 'parks', and 'division'. The artifact can be tangible or intangible and must be clearly identifiable in the text. In cases involving multiple items, each can be considered an artifact if part of the same transaction. Unlike related events, the primary focus here is on the ownership of the artifact.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that receives the artifact as a result of the transfer. Examples include 'nanny'. The beneficiary indicates who gains ownership or control of the artifact, which can be an individual or an organization. The beneficiary may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context. They are distinct from the buyer as they may receive the artifact without a financial transaction, such as in a gift or donation, and do not necessarily participate in the transaction process.",
            "buyer": "The buyer is the entity that acquires ownership of the artifact through purchase. Examples include 'company', 'Andrew Harris', 'firm', and 'Blackstone Group'. The buyer represents the party that gains ownership in exchange for compensation, typically monetary. The buyer can be an organization or a group and must be clearly identified in the text. Unlike the beneficiary, the buyer is actively involved in the transaction process, often providing payment or other forms of compensation.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transfer of ownership occurs or is relevant to the transaction. Examples include 'Belgrade', 'Sydney's Kings Cross', 'Florida', 'Spain', and 'Japan'. The place provides context and specificity to the event, indicating where the transaction is taking place or where the artifact is located. It may refer to multiple locations if the transaction involves assets in different areas. The place must be explicitly mentioned in the text and provides important contextual information about the event.",
            "seller": "The seller is the entity that transfers ownership of the artifact to another party. Examples include 'Mirjana Markovic', 'USA Interactive', 'Vivendi', and 'group'. The seller represents the party that relinquishes ownership in exchange for compensation or other considerations. The seller can be an organization or a group and must be clearly identified in the text. Unlike the buyer, the seller initiates the transfer of ownership, often receiving payment or other forms of compensation in return."

    "Transport(MovementEvent)": {
        "description": "The Transport event involves the movement of people, objects, or entities from one location to another, typically facilitated by an agent or vehicle. This event is characterized by a clear origin and destination, and the successful relocation of the artifact or victim. Example triggers include 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'deliver', and 'send'. The focus is on the process of movement rather than the completion of the journey.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for initiating or facilitating the transport, which can be a person, group, or organization. Examples include 'forces', 'troops', and 'parents'. The agent is distinct from the vehicle and may sometimes be implied, such as 'medical teams carting away victims'.",
            "artifact": "The artifact is the entity being transported, which can be a person, group, or object. Examples include 'women', 'children', 'troops', and 'tanks'. The artifact is central to the event and distinct from the agent. Multiple artifacts may be involved, such as 'bringing in more troops and tanks'.",
            "destination": "The destination is the endpoint of the transport, where the artifact is being moved to. Examples include 'Sudan', 'Iraq', and 'home'. The destination is crucial for defining the scope of the event and is distinct from the origin.",
            "origin": "The origin is the starting point of the transport, where the artifact begins its movement. Examples include 'Sudan', 'Pennsylvania', and 'Fort Hood'. The origin provides the initial location of the artifact and is distinct from the destination.",
            "place": "The place is a location relevant to the transport event, which may not necessarily be the origin or destination. Examples include 'Iraq', 'streets', and 'airfield'. The place provides additional context for the event and may overlap with the origin or destination.",
            "vehicle": "The vehicle is the means of transport used to move the artifact from the origin to the destination. Examples include 'trains', 'car', and 'airplane'. The vehicle is essential for understanding how the transport is carried out and is distinct from the agent.",
            "victim": "The victim is the entity being transported, often in a context where they are moved against their will or in a vulnerable state. Examples include 'who', 'victims', and 'soldiers'. The victim is central to the event and distinct from the agent, and may sometimes be implied."

    "TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "A TrialHearing event, a type of JusticeEvent, involves formal legal proceedings where evidence is examined before a judge or adjudicator, typically in a court setting. This event includes the presence of an adjudicator, a defendant, and often a prosecutor, and aims to determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Unlike other JusticeEvents such as 'Pardon' or 'Sentence', the focus is on the examination of evidence and arguments before reaching a verdict. The outcomes can vary, including acquittal, conviction, or mistrial. This event encompasses any formal legal proceeding, such as preliminary hearings, bail hearings, and full trials, regardless of the specific charges or legal system involved. Example triggers include 'trial', 'hearing', 'case', and 'tried'.",

            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator, such as a judge, court, or jury, is responsible for overseeing the trial or hearing and making legal decisions based on the evidence presented. They ensure the trial is conducted fairly and according to legal standards. The adjudicator can be a specific individual, like 'Judge John S. Martin', or a collective body, such as 'the court'. Unlike the prosecutor or defendant, the adjudicator is neutral and impartial. In some cases, the adjudicator may be inferred from the context, such as 'the trial will start on March 13', implying 'the court'.",
            "defendant": "The defendant, such as 'nichols', 'Anwar Ibrahim', 'wife', 'Markovic', or 'officials', is the individual or group being accused or tried in the trial or hearing. Central to the TrialHearing event, the defendant is the subject of the charges being examined. There may be multiple defendants, each accountable for the charges brought against them. Unlike the prosecutor, who represents the state or accuser, the defendant contests the charges and presents their defense. The defendant may be inferred from the context, such as 'the trial of the former president's wife', where 'wife' is the defendant.",
            "place": "The place, such as 'oklahoma city', 'New York', or 'Belgrade', is the location where the trial or hearing takes place. It provides context for the legal jurisdiction and setting of the trial or hearing. The place can be explicitly mentioned, like 'the Belgrade district court', or inferred from the context, such as 'a federal court in New York'. Unlike the adjudicator or defendant, the place is a static element that does not change throughout the event. It may be implied, such as 'the trial will start on March 13', where the location is the court handling the case.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor, such as 'prosecutors' or 'the prosecution', is the legal representative who brings the case against the defendant in a trial or hearing. They play a key role in presenting evidence and arguments to prove the defendant's guilt, representing the state or accuser. The prosecutor can be a specific individual or a group, responsible for building and presenting the case against the defendant. Unlike the defendant, who defends against the charges, the prosecutor advocates for the conviction based on the evidence. The prosecutor may be inferred from the context, such as 'the judge ruled that enough evidence was presented', implying 'prosecutors'."
