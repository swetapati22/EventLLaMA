This event involves the formal release of the defendant from legal charges, typically following a trial or legal review, and is characterized by the involvement of a legal authority (adjudicator). It is distinct from the 'Convict' event, which results in a guilty verdict, and the 'Pardon' event, which is an act of forgiveness for a crime. The outcome of the 'Acquit' event is the defendant being freed from legal charges, unlike the 'Appeal' event, which involves a request for a higher court to review a lower court's decision.

Edge cases include references to newborns or infants, where the term 'newborn' itself can be the person argument.
